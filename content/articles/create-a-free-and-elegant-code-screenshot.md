[kod.so](https://kod.so/?ref=maliksvd "Go to kod.so") is a free online snippet screenshot generator where you can create screenshots of your code snippets.

Transform your code by choosing from a range of syntax colors, hide or show the background, and many other customizations.

* 7 font name
* Font size

* And +8 more feature

However, if you want to share code to your community do not forget to propose a link to copy it directly because unfortunately it is not possible to copy the code via the image natively and it is a problem of accessibility. as Savvas Stephanides indicates on his article that I advise you on [dev.to](https://dev.to/savvasstephnds/the-problem-with-code-screenshots-and-how-to-fix-it-2ka0. "Go to Savvas Stephanides post")

Finally, Kod is a nice and easy way to create nice screenshots of clips quickly.
